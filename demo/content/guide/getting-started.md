# Getting Started

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 1.85 or newer (`cargo` is the only build tool the generator needs).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or newer, **once**, to produce the theme's CSS and JavaScript bundle. They are not checked in and not embedded in the binary yet, so a fresh checkout has to build them.
- A terminal and a text editor with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) support.

### Build from source

rustpress is not on crates.io yet. When it is, the crate will be named `rustpress-cli` (the `rustpress` crate name belongs to another project) and the installed binary will still be `rustpress`. For now, clone the repository and build it. The theme's CSS comes from vpkit, a separate repository that npm links from `../vpkit`, so clone it next to rustpress. The theme's stylesheet and script are produced by npm and then embedded into the binary, so the npm step has to run before `cargo build`:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/at-least/rustpress
$ git clone https://github.com/at-least/vpkit  # the theme's CSS, as ../vpkit
$ cd rustpress
$ npm install                      # tailwindcss CLI + esbuild + alpinejs + vpkit
$ npm run build:js && npm run build:css   # → static/js/app.js, static/vitepress.css
$ cargo build --release            # → target/release/rustpress
```

`cargo install --path .` puts the binary on your `PATH`. The binary is self-contained: the theme's `vitepress.css`, `js/app.js`, the Inter font files, the bundled color themes and the code-color themes are compiled into it (see [Theme assets](#theme-assets)), so the checkout is not needed afterwards.

## File Structure

A site is a directory containing a `rustpress.toml` and a `content/` tree of markdown files:

```
.
├─ my-docs
│  ├─ rustpress.toml
│  ├─ static/            # copied verbatim to the output root (optional)
│  └─ content
│     ├─ index.md
│     ├─ guide
│     │  └─ getting-started.md
│     └─ reference
│        └─ config.md
└─ ...
```

The site directory is the **project root**. `content/` is the [source directory](@/guide/routing.md#source-directory) (configurable with [`srcDir`](../reference/site-config#srcdir)), and `public/` inside the site directory is where the build output goes.

{% <vp_container type="tip"> %}
The build writes to `<site>/public`. If using Git, add it to your `.gitignore`.
{% </vp_container> %}

### The Config File

`rustpress.toml` mirrors VitePress's config, with VitePress's `themeConfig` keys flattened to the top level and spelled exactly as VitePress spells them (camelCase):

```toml
title = "My Docs"
description = "Just playing around."

[[nav]]
text = "Guide"
link = "/guide/getting-started/"

[[socialLinks]]
icon = "github"
link = "https://github.com/me/my-docs"
```

Unknown keys are rejected, so a typo fails the build instead of silently doing nothing. Consult the [Site Config](@/reference/site-config.md) and [Default Theme Config](@/reference/default-theme-config.md) references for every option.

### Source Files

Markdown files under `content/` are **source files**. rustpress uses **file-based routing**: each `.md` file becomes a directory-style URL — `index.md` is served at `/`, `guide/getting-started.md` at `/guide/getting-started/`. Routing, links and rewrites are covered in the [Routing Guide](@/guide/routing.md).

### Theme assets

Every generated page links `/vitepress.css`, `/js/app.js` and the fonts under `/fonts/`. These files, and the bundled color themes under `/themes/` (vpkit's), are embedded in the `rustpress` binary and written into `public/` on every build, so a site needs nothing beyond `rustpress.toml` and `content/` to come out fully styled.

Files in the site's own `static/` are copied over the embedded ones, so a `static/vitepress.css` of your own replaces the theme stylesheet (see [Theming](@/guide/coming-from-vitepress.md#theming) for the supported ways to change colors before going that far). A site can also layer any other directory over the output via the [`staticOverlay`](../reference/site-config#staticoverlay) config key — the rustpress demo and docs sites use it to pick up the checkout's freshly built CSS and JS without rebuilding the binary. See [Asset Handling](@/guide/asset-handling.md) for what else belongs in `static/`.

## Up and Running

Build the site:

```sh
$ rustpress build my-docs
rustpress: 3 pages + 404 + syntax.css + static/ → my-docs/public (0.0s)
```

Or start the dev server, which builds once, watches the site directory, rebuilds on every change and reloads open browser tabs:

```sh
$ rustpress serve my-docs
rustpress: serving my-docs/public on http://127.0.0.1:4173
```

Both commands default to the current directory when no site path is given. `--port` changes the dev server port. More command line usage is documented in the [CLI Reference](@/reference/cli.md).

## What's Next?

- To better understand how markdown files are mapped to generated HTML, proceed to the [Routing Guide](@/guide/routing.md).

- To discover what you can do on a page, refer to the "Writing" section of the guide. A great place to start is [Markdown Extensions](@/guide/markdown.md).

- To explore the features provided by the theme, check out the [Default Theme Config Reference](@/reference/default-theme-config.md).

- If you want to change the look of your site, see [Theming](@/guide/coming-from-vitepress.md#theming).

- If you already have a VitePress site, read [Coming from VitePress](@/guide/coming-from-vitepress.md) for what carries over.

- Once your documentation site takes shape, make sure to read the [Deployment Guide](@/guide/deploy.md).
